# About the Authors {#author .unnumbered}

Yihui is the main developer of the **blogdown** package. He did not start working on the systematic documentation (i.e., this book) until four months after he started the **blogdown** project. One day, he found a very nice **blogdown** tutorial via Twitter written by Amber Thomas. Being surprised that she could create a great personal website using **blogdown** and write a tutorial _when there was no official documentation_, Yihui immediately invited her to join him to write this book, although they had never met each other before. This definitely would not happen if Amber did not have a website.

## Yihui Xie {-}

Yihui Xie (<https://yihui.name>) is a software engineer at RStudio (<https://www.rstudio.com>). He earned his PhD from the Department of Statistics, Iowa State University. He is interested in interactive statistical graphics and statistical computing. As an active R user, he has authored several R packages, such as **knitr**, **bookdown**, **blogdown**, **animation**, **DT**, **tufte**, **formatR**, **fun**, **mime**, **highr**, **servr**, and **Rd2roxygen**, among which the **animation** package won the 2009 John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award (ASA). He also co-authored a few other R packages, including **shiny**, **rmarkdown**, and **leaflet**.

In 2006, he founded the Capital of Statistics (<https://cosx.org>), which has grown into a large online community on statistics in China. He initiated the Chinese R conference in 2008, and has been involved in organizing R conferences in China since then. During his PhD training at Iowa State University, he won the Vince Sposito Statistical Computing Award (2011) and the Snedecor Award (2012) in the Department of Statistics.

He occasionally rants on Twitter (https://twitter.com/xieyihui), and most of the time you can find him on GitHub (https://github.com/yihui).

He enjoys spicy food as much as classical Chinese literature.

## Amber Thomas {-}

Amber Thomas (<https://proquestionasker.github.io>) has always loved science, exploration, and discovery. Her natural curiosity, love of animals and the environment, and constant pursuit of knowledge led her into a marine biology and chemistry double major in college (BS/BA) and a Master's degree in Marine Sciences. That generally leads people to think that she was "playing with animals" all day.

And while she _did_ get to work with some amazing animals over the years...

Only about **5 - 10%** of her time was spent working with animals. The rest was spent designing experiments and working with data.

When a co-worker introduced her by saying "This is Amber, she does data analysis", she realized that, indeed, she was a data analyst (who happened to work with marine data).

So, she decided to pursue the analytical side of her work and enter the world of data science. She has been taking lots of classes, working on lots of personal projects, joining local Meetups, and looking for work in the field.

She is always looking for new people to chat with and new problems to solve, so feel free to reach out to her!
